# mod3_project

This repo contains:
* Description of the project in a PDF
* Three python starter files
* Three test files
* A starter jupyter notebook

Authors:
Joe Read and Mohammed Hannan

Dataset:
London TfL Bikepoint data combined with London geographical data.
Bikepoint data retrieved hourly for a single day, between 9AM and 6PM
We want to look at how the location of the bikepoint influences the condition
of the bikepoint. We will use the geographical data to see if the population
statistics have an impact on the usage of the bikepoint.

Hypotheses:
Faulty bikepoints are clustered together. 
Bikepoints at a high elevation are less frequently used.
Bikepoints have higher activity during rush hour.
Higher populated areas have more bike activity

APIS:
TfL BikePoint API.
Data Science Toolkit Coords to Statistics API.
